    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This berry buckle is tender and buttery and ideal for breakfast, dessert, or just for snacking on throughout the day. The best part of this simple cake is it's loaded with berries in every bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (67g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (67g) light brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup (150g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>3 cups (about 480g) mixed berries</li>
            <li>Turbinado sugar, for sprinkling</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>
            <p>Grease and line an 8x8-inch pan with parchment paper.</p>
            <li>Make the batter:</li>
            <p>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing in at medium-low speed and scraping the bowl in between additions. Add the vanilla extract and mix until combined.</p>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients:</li>
            <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix on low speed just until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.</p>
            <li>Fold in the berries:</li>
            <p>Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the berries into the batter. Spread the batter into the lined pan and generously sprinkle turbinado sugar on top.</p>
            <li>Bake:</li>
            <p>Bake until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center of the pan comes out clean (minus any berry juice), about 45 minutes.</p>
            <p>Transfer the pan to a wire rack. Allow to cool, then sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.</p>
            <p>Store at room temperature in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days.</p>
        </ol>
