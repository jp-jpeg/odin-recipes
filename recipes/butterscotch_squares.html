    <h1>Butterscotch Squares</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In essence, these squares are blondies by another name. They’re a simple combination of melted butter, brown sugar, and egg, with flour and baking powder to provide structure. I love to make them in one large bowl, mixing with a wooden spoon—no mixer required!</p>
    <p>They’re not fancy by any means, but they’re wonderfully chewy with a slight crispiness on the outer crust. The flavor of brown sugar is more pronounced than a typical blondie recipe, making them the tastiest simple-to-make treat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (57g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup (213g) light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (94g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped nuts</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <p>Prepare an 8x8-inch square pan by greasing it with cooking spray or butter.</p>
            <li>Make the batter:</li>
            <p>Melt the butter in the microwave or on the stove. In a medium mixing bowl, mix the warm melted butter with the brown sugar until combined. If needed, let the mixture cool for a few minutes to lukewarm, then mix in the egg.</p>
            <p>Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt into the bowl and gradually stir the dry ingredients into the brown sugar mixture.</p>
            <p>Stir in the vanilla extract and chopped nuts.</p>
            <li>Bake</li>
            <p>Spread the batter into the prepared square pan. Bake the butterscotch squares until the edges are golden and the top begins to crinkle, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and allow to cool at least 30 minutes before cutting.</p>
            <p>Store the butterscotch squares in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer storage, store the squares in a freezer bag in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
        </ol>
